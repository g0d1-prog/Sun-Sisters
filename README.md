- To change any props on the components of the frontend, you have to access the layout file and change the componentStyle

- To change the main frontend with the components, like images, or any texts, is on the App.js file

- To change anything on the backend is on the backend file, but to change and build any API, you'll have to create and edit to the apps of the backend, like the contactForm

- img file contains all images taken from the internet

- The frontend is deployed on Vercel and the backend is deployed on Heroku
